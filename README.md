</div>

Devzat is a chatroom right into your terminal! You can join on any device via SSH or our Slack and Discord integrations. We are a community of programmers, hobyists, or people just looking to socialize.

 <h3>Join Devzat via SSH</h3>

```sh
ssh devzat.hackclub.com
```

You can log in with a nickname:
```sh
ssh nickname@devzat.hackclub.com
```

If you're under a firewall, you can still join on port 443:
```sh
ssh devzat.hackclub.com -p 443
```
We also have a Slack bridge! If you're on the [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) Slack, check out the `#ssh-chat-bridge` channel!

Feel free to make a [new issue](https://github.com/quackduck/devzat/issues) if something doesn't work.

See the [status site](https://stats.uptimerobot.com/kxMQqfYk4y) of the main Devzat server to check if it might be down.

<h3>Some Commands to get you started...</h3>
Devzat has lots of cool fetures, games, and some secrets... Here are some basic commands to get you up and running!

```text
   =<user>   <msg>           DM <user> with <msg>
   color     <color>         Change your name's color
   exit                      Leave the chat
   man       <cmd>           Get help for a specific command
   bell      on|off|all      ANSI bell on pings (on), never (off) or for every message (all)
   clear                     Clear the screen
   cd        #room|user      Join #room, DM user or run cd to see a list
   tz        <zone> [24h]    Set your IANA timezone (like tz Asia/Dubai) and optionally set 24h
   nick      <name>          Change your username
   pwd                     Show your current room
   id       <user>         Get a unique ID for a user (hashed key)
'''
Type CMDS in the chat to get the full list.

<h3>Self-host your own Devzat instance</h3>

If you want to self host your own instance, you can grab basicly any LINUX/UNIX device with an internet connection and golang installed, and paste these commands in:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/quackduck/devzat && cd devzat
go install # or build, if you want to keep things pwd
ssh-keygen -qN '' -f devzat-sshkey # new ssh host key for the server
devzat # run! the default config is used & written automatically
```
These commands download, build, setup and run a Devzat server listening on port 2221, the default port (change by setting `$PORT`).
If you have trouble connecting to your devzat instance, you might be a pubkey issue so try to connect through port 443.

When self-hosting, Devzat can integrate with Slack and/or Discord to bridge messages, and Twitter to post new-user announcements. 
See the [Admin's Manual](Admin's%20Manual.md) for more info and configuration documentation.

Devzat has a plugin API you can use to integrate your own services: [documentation](plugin/README.md). Feel free to add a plugin to the main instance. Just ask for a token on the server.

<h3>We are still growing!</h3>

Devzat has a vibrant community, and it is still growing! Join today to make some friends, or start your own server today!
