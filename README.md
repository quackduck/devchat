# Devzat

Where are the devs at? Devzat!

Devzat is a chat, built in your SSH.

Because there's SSH apps literally on all platforms, even your phone, you can connect to Devzat on any device!

## Usage

Try it out:

```sh
ssh devzat.hackclub.com
```

If you're under a firewall, you can still join on port 443:
```sh
ssh devzat.hackclub.com -p 443
```

If you add this to `~/.ssh/config`:
```ssh
Host chat
    HostName devzat.hackclub.com
```

You'll be able to join with just:
```sh
ssh chat
```

We also have a Slack bridge! If you're on the [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) Slack, check out the `#ssh-chat-bridge` channel!

Welcome to Devzat! Devzat is chat over SSH: github.com/quackduck/devzat  
Because there's SSH apps on all platforms, even on mobile, you can join from anywhere.

Interesting features:
* Many, many commands. Check em out by using /commands.
* Markdown support! Tables, headers, italics and everything. Just use "\n" in place of newlines.  
   You can even send ascii art with code fences. Run /ascii-art to see an example.
* Emoji replacements ðŸ”¥ :rocket: => ðŸš€ (like on Slack and Discord)
* Code syntax highlighting. Use Markdown fences to send code. Run /example-code to see an example.

For replacing newlines, I often use bulkseotools.com/add-remove-line-breaks.php.
