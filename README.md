Devzat is a chatroom right into your terminal! You can join on any device via SSH or our Slack and Discord integrations. We are a community of programmers, hobyists, or people just looking to socialize.

 <h3>Join Devzat via SSH</h3>

```sh
ssh devzat.hackclub.com
```

You can log in with a nickname:
```sh
ssh nickname@devzat.hackclub.com
```

If you're under a firewall, you can still join on port 443:
```sh
ssh devzat.hackclub.com -p 443
```
We also have a Slack bridge! If you're on the [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) Slack, check out the `#ssh-chat-bridge` channel!

Feel free to make a [new issue](https://github.com/quackduck/devzat/issues) if something doesn't work.

See the [status site](https://stats.uptimerobot.com/kxMQqfYk4y) of the main Devzat server to check if it might be down.
