Devzat is chat over SSH: github.com/quackduck/devzat  
Because there's SSH apps on all platforms, even on mobile, you can join from anywhere.

Run cmds to see a list of commands.

Interesting features:
* Rooms! Run cd to see all Rooms and use cd #foo to join a new room.
* Markdown support! Tables, headers, italics and everything. Just use \\n in place of newlines.
* Code syntax highlighting. Use Markdown fences to send code. Run eg-code to see an example.
* Direct messages! Send a quick DirectMessage using =User <msg> or stay in DMs by running cd @User.
* Timezone support, use tz Continent/City to set your timezone.
* Built in Tic Tac Toe and Hangman! Run tic or hang <word> to start new games.
* Emoji replacements! \:rocket\: => :rocket: (like on Slack and Discord)

For replacing newlines, I often use bulkseotools.com/add-remove-line-breaks.php.
